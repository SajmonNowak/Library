This App lets you create your own digital library. The user can input what book he read, how many pages it has and how many he already read. 
Based on the input, the App shows if the user is finished with reading, did not start or is currently reading and displays it.
The user can change the books information or amount of pages by clicking the edit button.
He can also change the amount of pages read just by clicking in +/- buttons without changing the interface. 
The user's books are saved on his local computer. 

Skills learned:
- Organizing code
- Using Objects and Object Constructors
- dynamically create elemenents based on objects
- dynamically change objects based on user's input
- Implemented local storage to save the library on the user's computer
